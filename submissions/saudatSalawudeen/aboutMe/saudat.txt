My name is SAUDAT SALAWUDEEN. 
My dream is to become a reputable software engineer.
I am so glad I made it to the selection stage on Dufuna, and here I am.
I am so close to achieving my dream but yet still far as I am faced with couple of challenges that have draw me back.
All in all Dufuna is a moment in my life i will forever cherished.
I wish I could say more, perhaps after this give a lengthy testimony.
perhaps.

Thank you.
